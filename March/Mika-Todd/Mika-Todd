AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH INTERVIEW

READ THIS:

“I will paste an endless series of increasingly difficult challenges 
into the editor. Your task is to figure them out as best as you can, 
and remember that we're looking for qualities beyond how many 
questions you get through, such as technical communication and 
engineering best practices.

Feel free to use any online resources that you normally would, 
e.g. Google, Stack Overflow, documentation pages. Just don't look up 
the solution directly. And when you do look something up, let me know 
what you are looking up so I can understand your thought process. 
There are no penalties for looking things up.

There are also no penalties for errors, so don't be afraid to run your 
code with an expected outcome and use any error messages to your 
advantage in refactoring to get the desired outcome.

Remember the importance of testing your code as some of the problems 
will build on each other, so you want to make sure it works before 
moving on.

Also, be sure to verbalize your thought process, as your technical 
communication is something we're looking for. As you're thinking 
through it, be sure to keep me updated on your overall strategy. 
This will help me to assess how you might work in a pair programming 
session or group environment.

Lastly, I'm not able to give any technical feedback today, but you 
will receive feedback and the result of your interview directly from 
an Admissions Team Member within one week. We'll spend the last few 
minutes of the interview on any non-technical questions you may have. 
Do you have any questions now regarding the format of the interview?”

NEXT, CONFIRM THE FOLLOWING:

Cohort start date: April 19th
Interview #: 1
Candidate Location: LA

INTERVIEW BEGINS:
Send them the link to their CS Bin page: 
http://csbin.io/interview/INTERVIEWEE-NAME

The break down of questions given to interviewees should be as follows:
1 level 1 question
2 level 2 questions
2 level 3 questions
2 level 4 questions

***************************************************************
**LEVEL 1 CHALLENGES**
Problem B: minAndMax
Time: 0:00

// Declare a variable 'randomNums' and set it equal to an array that contain the numbers 1, 14, 7, 21, and -6.

+ uses const for an array
+ tests with expected value

/*
Create a function 'minAndMax' that takes an array of numbers and returns both the smallest and largest number in an array, in that order.
NOTE: do not use the native Math.min or Math.max methods. For example minAndMax([7, 68, 2, 19]) should return the array  [2, 68]
*/

+ talks through approach
+ uses the Infinity object
+ talks through why she uses let keyword
+ lays down pseudocode, really clear everyday language
+ uses indentation with pseudocode
+/- maybe too much time spent on approach
+ "ES5 function declaration"
+ got it on first pass of code
- unnecessary result variable
- no return keyword
+ good debugging

//  Check that your 'minAndMax' function is working correctly by passing your variable 'randomNums' to the 'minAndMax' function



***************************************************************
**LEVEL 2 CHALLENGES**
Problem A: passAllTests
Time: 8:35

/*
Create a function "between50And500" that takes a number as an argument.
"between50And500" should return a true if the number passed to it is between 50 and 500 exclusive.
For example, if the input is 45 then your function should return false and if the input is 472 it should return true.
*/

+ describes inputs and outputs
+ really great communication through the prompt
+ ES6 function expression with implicit return
+ ternary operator!
+ tests!

/*
Create a function "divBy100" that takes a number as an argument.
"divBy100" should return a true if the number passed to it is divisible by 100.
For example, if the input is 120 then your function should return false and if the input is 600 it should return true.
*/

+ really clear understanding of newer syntax/features

/*
Create a function "negativeOrEven" that takes a number as an argument.
"negativeOrEven" should return a true if the number passed to it is a negative number OR it is an even number.
For example, if the input is 7 then your function should return false and if the input is -3 it should return true.
*/

+ always uses pseudocode so I always know exactly what she's doing
+ precise technical communication logical or operator

/*
Create a function "passAllTests" that takes an array of functions and another value as arguments.
Each function in your array will return a boolean value. "passAllTests" should pass your value argument to each function.
If all functions in your array return true then "passAllTests" will return true. Otherwise "passAllTests" should return false
*/

+ callback functions 
- communication gets a bit less clear in terms of iteration
+ already is creating arrayOfFuncs
- using a variable to count true/false values
- kind of rounabout approach checking manually if every cb returns true
+ but it should work
+ using a for... of loop
+ corrects errors while she goes
+ great variable names

/*
Use your "passAllTests" function to test if the number 300 is greater than the number 50 and less than the number 500,
divisible by the 100, and a negative number OR even. Then test the number 250.
*/

+ talks through logic 
+/- catches error right away

Problem C: isPalindrome
Time: 28:00

/*
Define a function "isPalindrome" that takes a string, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is a palindrome
(a palindrome is any string that has the same value when reversed - for example, "LEVEL" or "RACECAR")
*/

+ good clarifying question about case
+ says she's going to use recursion to compare first and last letters
+ proabably seen this problem before in CSPrep
+ nice use of slice methods
+ consistent use of semi-colons
++ talks me through her use of slice
+ covers all expected outputs with tests


***************************************************************

**LEVEL 3 CHALLENGES**
Problem A: add
Time: 35:00

/*
Create a function "add" that takes an argument (a number) and returns a function.
The returned function should also take one argument (a number) and return the sum of its argument and the argument that was originally past to "add"
Example:
const addBy10 = add(10)
addBy10(20) -> 30
*/

+ immediately recognizes closure
+ "surrounding variable environment"
+ adjusts bracket indentation
+ talks through the implementation assigning invocation to a new variable and console logging that new function


Problem B: getLength
Time: 40:00

// Write a function "getLength" that returns the length of a string. Accomplish this without using any loops, native JS methods, or the length property.

+ immediately recognizes recursion
+ uses slice to remove elements until an empty string is hit for the base case
+ uses slice "to make a copy"
+ tests
+ missing default parameter but catches it right after reading error message

***************************************************************
**LEVEL 4 CHALLENGES**
Problem A: transpose
Time: 43: 00

/*
Write a function called 'transpose' that accepts a two dimensional array and returns a transposed version of that array.
Example:
const twoDimArray = [ ['fred', 'barney'], [30, 40], [true, false] ]
console.log(transpose(twoDimArray)); // -> [['fred', 30, true], ['barney', 40, false]]
*/

+ finds a pattern in example to build approach off of
+ uses a simple for loop
+ she got it!

Problem B: rotateGrid
Time:

/*
Write a function 'rotateGrid' that is given an NxN grid of elements represented by a 2D array, and outputs a grid equivalent to the same grid rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
Example:
const sampleGrid = [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9] ]
console.log(rotateGrid(sampleGrid)); // -> [ [7, 4, 1], [8, 5, 2], [9, 6, 3] ]
*/



***************************************************************

LAST 15 MINUTES
Ask some free flow questions. Free flow questions are to get a better sense of the applicant's knowledge of JavaScript. These are some common questions to ask, but will be different based on the interviewee.

**FREEFLOW QUESTIONS**

What is hoisting? 

+ variables that are hoisted by the JS parser

What is the difference between map, forEach, and a regular loop?

+ forEach is a HOF but not returning anything
+/- returns out an array for us but its a for loop

What is the difference between arrow function and regular function declaration?

+ ES6 = arrow
- talks about how functions get hoisted but not arrow functions
+ implicit return 

***************************************************************
CONCLUSION

General Notes: She was awesome! Great person and a solid halding of all the questions and non-technical skills. 

What They Did Well: Impeccable technical communication 

What They Didn't Do Well: some of her approaches were not the most optimized but all worked
