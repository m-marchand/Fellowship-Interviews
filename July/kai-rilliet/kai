AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH INTERVIEW

READ THIS:

“I will paste an endless series of increasingly difficult challenges 
into the editor. Your task is to figure them out as best as you can, 
and remember that we're looking for qualities beyond how many 
questions you get through, such as technical communication and 
engineering best practices.

Feel free to use any online resources that you normally would, 
e.g. Google, Stack Overflow, documentation pages. Just don't look up 
the solution directly. And when you do look something up, let me know 
what you are looking up so I can understand your thought process. 
There are no penalties for looking things up.

There are also no penalties for errors, so don't be afraid to run your 
code with an expected outcome and use any error messages to your 
advantage in refactoring to get the desired outcome.

Remember the importance of testing your code as some of the problems 
will build on each other, so you want to make sure it works before 
moving on.

Also, be sure to verbalize your thought process, as your technical 
communication is something we're looking for. As you're thinking 
through it, be sure to keep me updated on your overall strategy. 
This will help me to assess how you might work in a pair programming 
session or group environment.

Lastly, I'm not able to give any technical feedback today, but you 
will receive feedback and the result of your interview directly from 
an Admissions Team Member within one week. We'll spend the last few 
minutes of the interview on any non-technical questions you may have. 
Do you have any questions now regarding the format of the interview?”

***************************************************************

**LEVEL 3 CHALLENGES**
Problem B: sumAllElements
Time: 0:00

Driving: 
+ clarifying questions 
+ writes test case first
+ thinks we should use recursion
+ got caught on prompt restriction (no methods) but is moving forward well
+ solution works


Problem C: fastCache
Time: 16:00

+ strong understanding of closure from discussing prompt
- inefficient solution to checking for a key in an object
+ really easy to work with 
+ knows where to look to debug

***************************************************************

**LEVEL 4 CHALLENGES**
Problem A: deepCopy
Time: 35:00

+ had a good discussion about storage by reference in JavaScript --> getting it
+ knows we need to use recursion
+ strong base and recursive case
+ didn't finish but he's on his way to a solution and showed interest in learning about this topic
